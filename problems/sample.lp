\ LP format example


Maximize
 obj: 3 x + 4 y

Subject To
 c1: x + 2 y <= 8
 c2: 3 x + y <= 9

\ allow negative coefficients
\ maybe bouns in the future anomize inputs
\ for now, ranom coeffi solucients (-1, 1), with accuracy
\ allow origin in thetion space, otherwise not possible to solve
\ for next week: implement simplex - Antzig's Rule, try to r
